House Price Prediction

This project is focused on predicting house prices using a dataset that contains various features related to the properties. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide on data exploration, preprocessing, and model building to predict the sale prices of houses.

Project Structure

House_prediction.ipynb: The main notebook containing all the steps of the project, including:
Data loading and initial exploration
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.)
Feature engineering
Model selection and training
Evaluation of the model's performance
Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes features such as:

Lot Area
Year Built
Number of Rooms
Garage Type
Sale Price (Target Variable)
And many more...
This dataset is comprehensive and includes various categorical and numerical features relevant to real estate pricing.

Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following Python packages:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install these packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Usage

Navigate to the directory containing the notebook.
Open the House_prediction.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
Run the cells sequentially to execute the code and see the results.
Key Steps in the Notebook

Data Exploration: Understanding the distribution and relationships between variables.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Training: Training machine learning models to predict house prices.
Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
Results

The final model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The notebook also provides visualizations to better understand the model's predictions versus the actual house prices.

Conclusion

This project provides a solid foundation for building predictive models for real estate pricing. It can be further enhanced by experimenting with different models, tuning hyperparameters, or using more advanced feature engineering techniques.
